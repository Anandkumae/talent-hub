/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the Internal Talent Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and a public-read, owner-write model for jobs. Candidates are publicly accessible, enabling open applications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /jobs/{jobId}: Stores job postings, publicly readable, but only writable by the user who created the job.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores candidate data, publicly readable and writable, allowing open applications.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private and only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * - Job postings are publicly visible, but modification is restricted to the job creator.
 * - Candidate data is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to apply.
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy reasons.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Job' entity includes a 'postedBy' field, which stores the user ID of the job creator. This denormalization is CRITICAL for securing write access to job postings. Without it, the rules would need to perform a costly and complex `get()` operation on the user document to verify ownership.
